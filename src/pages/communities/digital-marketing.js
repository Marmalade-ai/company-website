        <h2>How Can I Do Better as a Freelancer in Digital Marketing?</h2>
        <p>
          &quot;How can you help me do <b>better</b> as a freelancer in digital
          marketing?&quot; If you found us through a search query, was it
          something like this? Did you get a pile of results that seemed like
          the answers to a different question: How can I be kept away from my
          peers, fall into the trap of price competition, and be one of many
          freelancers, hoping to have their name drawn from the barrel?
        </p>
        <p>
          We&apos;re so glad you found us! We hope you can use Marmalade AI to
          actually answer that very question: &quot;How can you help me do
          better as a freelancer in digital marketing?&quot;
        </p>
        <h2>Virtual Network</h2>
        <p>
          The short answer is: sign up and use a virtual network generated by
          applying NLP to your profile to connect with other specialists in
          digital marketing. How do you get a profile? You can copy and paste
          from elsewhere, or write it from scratch. Either way, it&apos;s quick
          to register. Instead of years to build up a network, a virtual network
          takes minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The long answer is: by using Marmalade AI you can have a digital
          marketing network to raise the level of your work. We&apos;re in the
          era of virtualization -- so why not a <i>virtual network</i> for
          freelancers? It&apos;s the same idea. Your virtual network reflects
          your profile. It is normally composed of other digital marketing
          freelancers with related specializations. It changes when you change
          your profile (caveat: in &quot;Early Access,&quot; it changes the next
          time our matching engine runs; which is not in real time currently).
        </p>
        <p>
          This means you can use your virtual network, for example, to find
          someone to help on part of a digital marketing project where you
          realize you lack the expertise. Say you are a &quot;content&quot;
          specialist and part of the project turns out to require current SEO
          skills. Or maybe you can help someone doing an email marketing project
          and you know about the latest in CCPA, GDPR, etc. relative to email
          marketing. A lot of projects have scope in which I can do what
          I&apos;m good at, but one-tenth of the scope might be in a less
          familiar area that will make it end up being a money-losing project.
          The goal of Marmalade AI is to be a platform where your virtual
          network enables you to focus on what you&apos;re good at.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transactions are &quot;one shoe&quot; and the &quot;other shoe&quot;
          is learning. How do you efficiently stay current in topics that are
          important to, but not core to, your expertise? How about if you could
          create a virtual room at 12:00pm (EST) tomorrow to discuss the latest
          in SEO and send notifications about it to people who have indicated an
          interest in that topic. It&apos;s like wikis or forum boards, or maybe
          like the good parts of Clubhouse, but more exact. That&apos;s where we
          want to go with the communications side of things, so please let us
          know what you think.
        </p>
        <h2>Evolution and Road Map</h2>
        <p>
          How did we come to focus on virtual networking for digital marketing
          freelancers, what&apos;s in it for you, and how can you help guide its
          evolution to be really useful for you?
        </p>
        <p>
          We started from a lot of &quot;user research.&quot; We learned many
          interesting, little details. For example: In the case of
          Japanese-English simultaneous interpreting gigs in the financial
          market (New York and Tokyo), the &quot;freelancers&quot; have 10
          agency business cards and the agencies do all the work of talking to
          clients and figuring out who is available when for what? Or, maybe
          twice-weekly ping-pong meetups attended predominantly by software
          engineers and bankers are 10x more efficient than monthly Meetup.com
          events when it comes to networking. The details were the important
          part. Bottom line: You have to enable the details to get it to work.
        </p>
        <p>We also learned:</p>
        <p>
          One-on-ones always seem less useful than they could be (serendipity!
          We both like hiking. OK, now what?) Also, everybody is the worst at
          keeping their network up-to-date on what they&apos;re doing (people
          would help, if they only knew!). And, finally, everybody believes they
          already have the biggest network they could possibly have.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we start with problem #3, provide virtual networks as a solution,
          and that solves the other two.
        </p>
        <p>
          The putative road map is to start with simple matching (<i>alpha</i>,
          aka &quot;Early Access&quot;) that evolves into use of NLP to create
          freelancer communities and then add in communications support (
          <i>beta</i>); then, second, make it easier to work together (legal and
          accounting issues, project management, that kind of thing); and,
          third, open the gates to hiring companies and recruiters
          (&quot;two-sided market&quot;) while maintaining freelancer control of
          how the market works.
        </p>
        <h2>Community First, Then Everything Else</h2>
        <p>
          The actual road map is up to you. The evolution of Marmalade AI is
          really subject to what you have to say about it. That&apos;s why we
          have a forum and this is Early Access. It&apos;s all malleable. We do
          think that a core idea is using technology (NLP, virtualization) to
          enable more exact connections more easily. How exactly that plays out
          in creating a platform for community is really up to you.
        </p>
        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p>
          OK, so Marmalade AI is using NLP in R with MLOps on Google Cloud to
          connect with phones, tablets, laptops, desktops (Vue.js) as client
          devices. Before that we wrote Python code using XPath to look at
          thousands of freelancer profiles and develop models. In the Marmalade
          AI app, the data is in the cloud and the client system is an interface
          to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope you will tell us where we are wrong and need to change our
          thinking. For example, initially we thought evaluation of meetings
          after the fact would be important. Then we realized that would be a
          waste of time. A freelancer&apos;s profile should be like a
          &quot;remote control&quot; -- change the wording in your profile to
          change your virtual network. We also decided to not use work history
          and education history, even though we had those, because tech
          freelancers already express (or could express) their focus clearly
          enough in just their profile text.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have many, many questions you can help with, and we reserve the
          right to be wrong and change our thinking. For example, will you be
          open to communication with people you don&apos;t know? We think if the
          context is vague, the answer is no. But if the context is relevant,
          the answer is yes. Or, we think this eventually should be a
          subscription service free of ad, with pay-for-use for actually doing
          paying work over the platform. The idea is monetizing based on
          creating actual value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marmalade AI is not going to deliver a BERT or GPT-3 equivalent for
          NLP in networking. Why not? Mainly because we think any level of
          matching that is more exact than what happens now will have value.
          Does it need to be real-time? Not clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the sign-up form, we ask freelancers in digital marketing to
          identify their specializations. So indicate in the registration your
          interest in areas such as SEO, Wordpress, content, new market
          development, website development, positioning, competitive analysis,
          collateral, influencer marketing, branding, inbound marketing, growth,
          data analytics, ecommerce, paid media and advertising, social media,
          events, and customer journeys.
        </p>
        <h2>Please Tell Use What to Do Next!</h2>
        <p>
          If we missed a digital marketing specialization, please tick
          &quot;other&quot; and let us know. More broadly, we said a little
          about what we think is on the road map: 1) community, 2) co-working,
          3) control. But that is subject to what we hear from you. Please
          invite people you are already working with, think you could be working
          with, and explore virtual networking. We are big believers in
          self-organizing communities.

          As a freelancer in digital marketing, I would like to join the free
          Early Access testing program to use the Marmalade AI peer networking
