        <h2>How Can I Have a Better Network in Digital Marketing?</h2>
        <p>
          If you found us through a <b>search query</b>, was it something like
          that? Or did you get results that seemed like answers to a different
          question?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are so glad you found us after all! We hope you can use Marmalade
          AI to actually answer that very <b>question</b>: &quot;How can you
          help me have better network in digital marketing?&quot;
        </p>
        <h2>Virtual Network</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>short answer</b> is: sign up and use Marmalade AI&apos;s
          virtual network that is derived from your profile. Marmalade AI will
          connect you with other specialists in digital marketing. So how do you
          get a profile? Well, you can copy and paste from elsewhere, or write
          it from scratch. Either way, it is quick to register. Instead of
          taking years to build up a network, a virtual network takes minutes
          and reflects your profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <b>long answer</b> is: by using Marmalade AI you can have a
          digital marketing network where you can <b>raise the level</b> of your
          work. We are in the era of virtualization -- so why not a{' '}
          <b>
            <i>virtual network</i>
          </b>{' '}
          for digital marketing? Your virtual network reflects your profile. It
          is composed of other digital marketing people with related
          specializations. It changes when you change your profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means you can use your virtual network to <b>find help</b> on
          part of a digital marketing project where you you lack the right
          expertise. For example, say you are a &quot;content&quot; specialist
          and part of the project turns out to require current SEO skills. Or
          maybe you can help someone doing an email marketing project and you
          know about the latest in CCPA, GDPR, etc. requirements for email
          marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of projects have <b>scope</b> in which I can do what I am good
          at, but one-tenth of the scope might be in a less familiar area that
          will make it end up being a money-loser. The goal of Marmalade AI is
          to be a platform where your virtual network enables you to focus on
          what you are good at.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do you efficiently stay current in topics that important to, but
          not core to, your expertise? How about, for example, if you could
          create a virtual room this afternoon to discuss the latest in SEO, and
          bring it to the attention of people who have indicated an expertise in
          that. It is like wikis or forum boards, or maybe like the good parts
          of Quora.com or Clubhouse, but more exact.

          and this is Early Access. We think that a core idea is using
          technology (ML, NLP, virtualization, communications) to enable more
          exact connections more easily. How exactly that plays out in creating
          a platform for community is really up to you.
