        <h2>How Can I Do Better as a Freelancer in UX Design?</h2>
        <p>
          &quot;How can you help me do <b>better</b> as a freelancer in UX
          design?&quot; We hope that is the kind of Google query that brought
          you to us. You probably had to sort through a LOT of irrelevant
          results to that query that assumed you wanted to be isolated in a
          silo, priced as low as possible as if you were a commodity, and be one
          of multitudes of undifferentiated freelancers waiting in the dark
          outside the door, hoping to be chosen for a project.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&apos;re excited that you found us! We want you to be able to use
          Marmalade AI to answer that very question: &quot;How can you help me
          do better as a freelancer in UX design?&quot;
        </p>
        <h2>Virtual Network</h2>
        <p>
          The easy answer is: by signing up and working with the virtual network
          that is automatically created on the basis of your profile, which you
          can copy and paste from elsewhere, or write from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The longer answer is: by using Marmalade AI to build a network where
          you can raise the level of your work. Your <i>virtual network</i>{' '}
          reflects your profile, so it is specific to you, and that is the whole
          point. It even changes when you change your profile. You can use your
          virtual network to find help for part of a project where you realize
          it&apos;s not your thing, or to help others in the same way. Or to pop
          up a virtual room on a topic and expedite learning the latest. The
          idea is that you can use the platform to do everything you did through
          traditional networking but more exactly and faster. Marmalade AI wants
          to make networking as efficient and useful as possible, and get out of
          the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let that sink in: <i>virtual network</i>. All you need to do is keep
          your profile current with the kind of work you do.
        </p>
        <h2>Evolution and Road Map</h2>
        <p>
          How did Marmalade AI come to focus on virtual networking for UX design
          freelancers, what&apos;s in it for you, and how can you help guide its
          evolution to be really useful to you?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our vision has evolved. Yes, everybody needs to network. Freelancers
          even more frequently. Marmalade AI hopes to become a platform for
          communities, and we chose to launch in three areas of tech freelancing
          so that Marmalade AI would not be overly parochial in designing a
          community platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want this to be more about you, building a network of UX design
          freelancers who can find each other more easily, share projects, keep
          their knowledge base up-to-date. There is no shortage of applications
          that favor the buyer of freelance UX design services. In some cases,
          these are very broad. In other cases, they&apos;re very narrow.
          We&apos;re not doing that.
        </p>
        <h2>Community First, Then Everything Else</h2>
        <p>
          Our idea is to enable a brotherhood and sisterhood of freelancers, and
          put the freelancers in control. So down the road -- once we have the
          virtual networking aspect working -- the idea is to make it easy -- on
          the platform -- to pop up a virtual room on a very specific topic, say
          when you are available, and whether you are open to invitations, and
          if so, on what. And then, do you want to be contacted about project
          work? If so, by whom, when and how defined? In other words, the
          freelancer is in control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marmalade AI&apos;s core idea is to make networking virtual. By doing
          so, the platform makes networking much more efficient. It&apos;s not
          really all that complicated of an idea. Would you want to read a book
          by somebody you don&apos;t know? Well, yes, if it&apos;s relevant.
          Same thing with virtual networking.
        </p>
        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p>
          Marmalade AI works by applying NLP (Natural Language Processing,
          machine learning, AI -- whatever you want to call it) to
          freelancers&apos; profiles. Your virtual network evolves as more
          people join. You can invite people you currently work with or would
          like to connect with. It also is automatic, and if you change the
          wording of your profile, eventually your virtual network will change.
          It&apos;s like affective reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          UX design freelancers tend to work from a portfolio and maybe share
          examples of their design thinking over Dribbble, behance, or similar
          sites. Do we need to replicate any of that? We think probably not.
          Just put a link to your portfolio in your profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the sign-up form, we ask freelancers in UX design to identify their
          specializations. NLP will be the engine, once we scale up. In the near
          term, simple matching will more than suffice. So indicate in the
          registration your interest in areas such as graphic design, creative
          design, UX design, CX, wireframing, conversational design,
          prototyping, A/B testing, mobile, packaging, healthcare, industrial,
          research, information architecture, UI developer, interaction design,
          and UX writer.
        </p>
        <h2>Please Tell Use What to Do Next!</h2>
        <p>
          If we missed a UX design specialization, please tick &quot;other&quot;
          and let us know. More broadly, we said a little about what we think is
          on the road map: 1) community, 2) co-working, 3) control. But that is
          subject to what we hear from you. Please invite people you are already
          working with, think you could be working with, and explore virtual
          networking. We are big believers in self-organizing communities.
        </p>

          As a freelancer in UX design, I would like to join the free Early
